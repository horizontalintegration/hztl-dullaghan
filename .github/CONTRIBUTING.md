## Workflow

We utilize [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as or preferred workflow method. The project has two persistent branches:

- `main` the current release branch
- `develop` the current working branch, new changes should be branched from and merged to here.
